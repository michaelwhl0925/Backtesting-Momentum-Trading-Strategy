# Backtesting-Momentum-Trading-Strategy

Hello :D

In this program, I am trying to backtest one of the common trading strategies - Momentum Strategy.
Shortly speaking, investors will long/short securities which show an upward/downward trend

Here, I only backtest the returns for the case of "buying rising stocks only" & I rebalance my portfolio each week and each month.

The default number of winners chosen are 5

Conclusion: rebalancing my asset allocation each month outplays rebalancing it each week
