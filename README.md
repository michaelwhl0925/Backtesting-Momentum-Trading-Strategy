# Backtesting-Momentum-Trading-Strategy

Hello :D

In this program, I am trying to backtest one of the common trading strategies - Momentum Strategy
Shortly speaking, investors will buy/sell securities which show an upward/downward trend

Here, I only backtest the returns for the case of "long rising stocks only" if I rebalance my portfolio each week and each month
The default number of winners are 5

Conclusion: rebalancing my asset allocation each month outplays rebalancing it each week
